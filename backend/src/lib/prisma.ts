 * Pins the PostgreSQL session time zone to UTC.
 *
 * Prisma 7.10's pg adapter sends JavaScript Dates as UTC wall-clock text
 * without an offset, which PostgreSQL interprets in the session time zone. On
 * a server set to Asia/Riyadh every timestamp Prisma wrote was stored three
 * hours early, while database-side now() (defaults, the audit function) was
 * right — so comparisons between the two were off by three hours. Prisma's own
 * reads hide it (the offset is stripped again), and CI's UTC container never
 * shows it. Found in commit 5 by the break-glass expiry test.
 *
 * The flag is appended to any startup options already in the URL; PostgreSQL
 * applies the last -c for a setting, so an operator's TimeZone cannot win.
