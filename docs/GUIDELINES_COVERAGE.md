# Guidelines coverage matrix

Every user-facing task in V04, traced from the screen to the rule that enforces it, and the Guidelines section that explains it. Built by reading the code on 2026-10-01 (release after `cb43df5`); the in-app Guidelines (`/guidelines`) and the [user manual](USER_MANUAL.md) are written from this table.

**Status:** **Implemented** — on a screen and enforced by the server. **Partial** — the server supports it but the screen does not offer it (an API client or a later screen would), or part of it is missing. **Planned** — not available; said so in the Guidelines.

Permissions are from [`permissions.ts`](../backend/src/modules/users/permissions.ts); "HR" = HR Admin, "SA" = System Admin (counts only while elevated, R13), "Sup" = Supervisor, "Emp" = any signed-in account linked to an employee. Scope (unit / department / hospital-wide) narrows every staff permission.

## Not covered because they are not user tasks

FHIR read API (`/fhir/*`, for other systems with an API client), the exit package (a server command, `ops/vps/README.md` §8) and the background jobs' own work are described where a user meets their result, not as tasks.
