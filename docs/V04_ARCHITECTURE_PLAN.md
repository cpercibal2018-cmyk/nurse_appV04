# V04 Architecture Plan

## 1. Goals

1. **Server-side business rules.** V03 enforces most rules in the browser store (`app/src/lib/store.tsx`) and exposes a generic CRUD API that bypasses them. V04 enforces every rule in backend services and database constraints. The frontend displays and collects data only.
2. **One of everything:** frontend, backend, schema, migration chain, API, RBAC, eligibility engine, workforce logic, audit path, specification.
3. **No invented requirements.** Items marked NOT ESTABLISHED in `FEATURE_MASTER_INVENTORY.md` get no module, no table and no seeded values.
4. **Readable by a new developer:** feature → folder is obvious; no historical code in the tree.

## 2. Repository layout

```

**No `agency/` module** (NOT ESTABLISHED). **No `shared/` package.** The only logic both sides need is Hijri conversion (~30 lines on `Intl`) and a PDF pre-check. The backend is authoritative for both; the frontend copies exist only to give instant form feedback. They are small and documented as display helpers, which costs less than adding a third package to build. Revisit if more shared logic appears (decision D-12).

## 3. Backend design

| Concern | Choice | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Runtime | Node **22 LTS** (not 20) | Spec §0.2 names Node 20, but Node 20 reached end-of-life in April 2026 (decision D-13) |
| HTTP | Express 5 | Brief requirement; async error propagation built in |
| ORM | Prisma (stable major pinned at implementation, no RC) | Brief requirement |
| Validation | zod schemas per route | Replaces class-validator DTOs; one schema = types + runtime check |
| Auth | Port of `server/src/auth.ts` (HS256 pinned, bcrypt, rotating refresh with family revocation, CSRF double-submit + Origin on refresh) | Already correct and tested in V03; add login rate limiting, password change, session absolute limit (D-6) |
| Authorization | `authorize(permission)` middleware + `scope` object passed to services | One implementation. Effective roles read fresh from `role_assignments` per request (R9); SYSTEM_ADMIN requires active PAM (R13) |
| Permissions | Static table `permissions.ts` (area × action → roles) derived from spec §8.1 | Readable; testable; mirrored in RBAC.md |
| Transactions | Services receive `tx` (Prisma interactive transaction) for every write; audit + eligibility refresh use the same `tx` | A1, L6 |
| Audit | `lib/audit.ts` → `SELECT fn_append_audit_entry(...)` on the caller's `tx` | One write path; serialized chain (A3) |
| Documents | `lib/storage.ts` interface: `LocalDiskStorage` (dev), `S3CompatibleStorage` (later); checksum + PDF check server-side; download streams only CLEAN | D1–D4; vault/ClamAV per D-10 |
| Jobs | `jobs/` run in the API process in development and in a separate worker process (`node dist/jobs/worker.js`) in production; each wrapped in `withLease` (V49) | Spec §10.2 wants a separate worker; the lease makes both modes safe |
| Residency | kit `residency.check.ts` in `config/residency.ts`, called before `listen` | R-1, spec §8.3 |
| Redis | **Not used** | Spec §9.3 makes Redis non-authoritative. RBAC reads the DB every request; nothing in scope needs a cache |
| Logging | JSON logs with `X-Request-Id`; no PII in logs | Spec §9.2 intent; `request_logs` table deferred |

### Module rules

- A module exposes `routes.ts` (HTTP) and `service.ts` (logic). Other modules call its **service**, never its routes or its tables directly. Exceptions: `audit` and `eligibility.state.refresh`, which every mutating module calls.
- Pure rule functions (`contracts/rules.ts`, `eligibility/engine.ts`, `users/role-rules.ts`) take plain data and return decisions. They are the unit-test surface and have no Prisma import.

### Eligibility engine contract

```
evaluate(facts: {employee, position, contracts, requirements, credentials, waivers, date}) → {status, reasons[]}
```

This implements spec §6.1 order (L4) exactly, with grace (L8), waivers per template (L9) and transitions (L10). `state.service.refresh(employeeId, event, tx)` loads facts and upserts `eligibility_states`. Callers: onboarding, contract create/transition, credential verify/suspend/revoke/expire, position change, requirement change, waiver create/expire, daily job. Publication calls `evaluate` directly for the shift date (L7).

## 4. Frontend design

| Concern | Choice |
| :--- | :--- |
| Stack | React 19, Vite 8, TypeScript strict, antd **6** (retained family: every V03 screen uses antd; v6 supports React 19 natively, v5 needs a compatibility patch), react-router **8** (declarative mode), i18next (en/ar + RTL retained). *Implementation note (commit 4): majors moved from the draft's React 18 / antd 5 / router 6 because those were superseded when V04 started.* |
| Server state | React Query hooks in `modules/<domain>/api.ts`; mutations show server errors (no optimistic fire-and-forget) |
| Client state | Zustand only for session (user, roles, scopes) and UI preferences (theme, language) |
| Auth | `services/http.ts` (from V03 `api.ts`): in-memory access token, CSRF header, single-flight refresh. Login waits for the server; no email-based role guessing |
| Access UI | `usePermissions()` derived from `/auth/me`; navigation and buttons hidden when not permitted. **Never the enforcement point** |
| Standalone demo mode | **Removed** (D-1). The app always needs the API |
| Bundle | Route-level lazy loading; the signed-in shell, login form and 404 page are lazy too. Fail-closed budget gate in CI. *Commit 4 fixed a gate defect:* the kit version chose entry files by name (`index-*`, `vendor-react-*`) and missed shared chunks loaded at startup; it now counts exactly what `index.html` loads (module script + modulepreloads). Budgets unchanged (200 KB gz initial, 150 KB gz per chunk) |

Pages carried over, re-pointed at domain endpoints: Login, Dashboard, Nurses (list, onboarding, detail/edit), Contracts (create, renew, transitions, documents), Credentials (catalog, requirements, records, my credentials, verification queue: **new**), Eligibility (states, details, waivers), Workforce (departments, units + bed grid + CSV, positions + assignment, coverage targets: **new**, KPI), Scheduling (week/month board, pool, auto-generate, publish, coverage), Attendance (gaps view), Notifications, Audit (+ verify), Administration (accounts, role assignments, approvals, PAM).

**Porting order (commit 4 implementation note):** V03 pages read and write the browser store that enforced business rules, so each page is ported in the commit that delivers its backend module (5–9). Commit 4 ships the shell (layout, routing, HTTP client, session, i18n/RTL, login, dashboard health) and one scaffold page per module stating what it will contain.

Removed pages: Observability (static values) and the Admin display tabs (Backup/PITR, Privilege separation, FHIR, PDPL static text). Their content moves into `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` / `docs/SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md`. Observability returns when real metrics exist.

## 5. Data

See `history/DATABASE_CONSOLIDATION.md` (26 models, Prisma Migrate, constraints in migration SQL, one seed). Local dev and CI use PostgreSQL **15** (spec target; drill verified on 15.19). `docker-compose.yml` moves from `postgres:16` to `postgres:15`.

## 6. Scope of V04 (proposal)

| In V04 | Deferred (stays in spec, own migration later) | Not established — not built |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Auth (+ password change, rate limit, own login/session history — D-22), accounts, scoped role assignments, four-eyes, PAM | SSO, MFA (IdP undecided) | Password reset; username login (D-21) |
| Nurse master + contract-first onboarding | Invitation/claim flow (needs SMTP) | Agency workforce |
| Contracts with transition map, documents | — | Leave, absence, attendance states |
| Credentials incl. verification, renewal, suspend/revoke, expiry job | SCFHS sync (U3), ClamAV/vault (D-10) | Overtime, mandatory rest, fatigue |
| Eligibility engine + state + grace + waivers + transitions | Consistency auditor, shadow mode | Acuity, skill mix, mandatory posts |
| Workforce: depts, units, beds (bulk/CSV), positions, coverage targets, KPI (D-11) | Observability metrics | Staffing-ratio enforcement |
| Scheduling: draft, pool, auto-generate, publish, coverage | Demotion notifications to supervisors beyond in-app | |
| Attendance: event ingest + gap query | Feed integration (B-15) | |
| Notifications: in-app + daily scan (N1–N4) | SMTP delivery (adapter present, disabled by default), push | Approval notification rules |
| Audit: single chain + verify; security events | Request log table, PDPL encryption/crypto-shredding (B-07/B-18) | |
| Break-glass: minimal per D-9 | Split-credential ceremony (operational) | |
| Idempotency on onboarding/bulk/publish; worker leases | FHIR, exit package, migration bridge | |

## 7. Commit sequence (stage 2, after approval)

Follows the brief; each commit builds.

| # | Commit | Contents | Build gate |
| :-: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | V04 architecture skeleton | workspaces, backend/ frontend/ empty apps, lint/tsconfig, docker-compose (pg15), CI skeleton, docs moved in | `npm run build` both |
| 2 | Database consolidation | schema, `0001_init` migration with SQL constraints/trigger/audit fn, seed (reference + demo) | `prisma validate`, `migrate deploy` twice (drift check), seed twice (idempotent) |
| 3 | Backend consolidation | app/server, config, residency, errors, request-id, prisma, audit lib, health | server starts; health 200 |
| 4 | Frontend consolidation | layout, routing, http client, i18n, login shell, module scaffolds with existing pages ported | `vite build`, bundle gate |
| 5 | Authentication and RBAC | auth, users, role assignments, approvals, PAM, authorize middleware, permissions table | auth + RBAC integration tests |
| 6 | Clinical eligibility | credentials (catalog, requirements, records, documents, lifecycle), engine, state, waivers, grace | engine unit tests from spec acceptance tables |
| 7 | Workforce | departments, units, bed bulk/CSV, positions, coverage targets, nurses + onboarding, contracts | integration tests |
| 8 | Scheduling and attendance | roster, pool, publish, coverage, auto-generate, attendance events/gaps | integration tests |
| 9 | Notifications and audit | scan job, notification API, audit query/verify, jobs + leases, break-glass | job tests with leases |
| 10 | Tests | end-to-end scenarios from brief Phase 15 "Business logic" list | full suite |
| 11 | Documentation | final authoritative doc set | link check |
| 12 | Cleanup | remove anything temporary, CLEANUP_REPORT.md | full validation matrix |

## 8. Documentation set (final)

`docs/SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md` · `ARCHITECTURE.md` · `DATABASE_ARCHITECTURE.md` · `RBAC.md` · `CLINICAL_ELIGIBILITY.md` · `WORKFORCE.md` · `API.md` · `DEPLOYMENT.md` · `MIGRATION.md` · `CLEANUP_REPORT.md`, plus `docs/reference/AIGH_Nursing_Workforce_Management_System_v2_8_7.md` (verbatim spec for traceability; every condensed doc cites its sections). The seven analysis reports produced now fold into these and are then retired (they describe V03, not V04).

*Implementation note (commit 11):* written as planned, with an index at [docs/README.md](README.md). `SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md` is an **amendment register** over the verbatim reference (amendments, clarifications, open conflicts, not established, deferred) rather than a rewritten specification, so no rule is paraphrased away. `API_MAP.md` became `API.md` (its V03 part moved to an appendix; section numbers kept because code cites them). The actual repository layout, which differs in detail from §2 above (no `validate.ts`, no `ops/db/`, no `components/` beyond three shells), is in `ARCHITECTURE.md`. The stage-1 analysis reports stay until commit 12 decides their fate; `CLEANUP_REPORT.md` is commit 12.

## 9a. Decision record (2026-09-23)

| ID | Decision | Effect on the spec / plan |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| D-1 | **Remove** offline demo mode | Frontend always requires the API |
| D-2 | ~~Local only for now~~ — **superseded 2026-09-23:** the owner asked to sync to `https://github.com/cpercibal2018-cmyk/nurse_appV04` (branch `main`); local working copy `C:\WebApp_project\Local_Repo\nurse_appV04` | No V03 tag yet |
| D-3 (C-1) | Onboarding creates a **Draft** contract | **Spec §3.1 amended:** onboarding is atomic (employee + Draft contract + audit); coverage starts only after HR approval (rule C2). Recorded in SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION as a deliberate deviation |
| D-4 (C-2) | **Allow** when no requirement is configured | **Spec §6.1 check 4 amended:** absence of rules is not blocking. The engine adds an informational reason `NO_REQUIREMENTS_CONFIGURED` so the gap stays visible, never silent |
| D-5 (C-8) | **Remove** `DEVELOPER` role | One seeded demo user per real role |
| D-11 (K1) | **Keep** the Ada'a KPI page | Thresholds marked "source not in repository — verify against MoH Ada'a card" in WORKFORCE.md and on the page |
| D-16 (C-5) | **Remove** staffing formula | `CoverageTarget` configured by HR; unset = "unspecified" |
| D-18 (C-7) | **Corrected during implementation:** requirement `unit` is **required**, `position` null = every position in the unit | Spec §5.1.4 states "a unit (required)"; the earlier recommendation (null unit = all units) came from the V03 NestJS schema and contradicted the spec. Matches V03 app behaviour |
| C-17 (new) | Accepted upload types | Contract copy: PDF only (V03 decision, commit `1508316`). Credential evidence: PDF, JPEG, PNG, WebP (spec §5.3.2 allowlist) |
| All others | Recommendations in §9 adopted (D-6…D-10, D-12…D-15, D-17, D-19, D-20) | Can be revisited at any commit |
| D-21 (2026-09-23) | **Login by email only** | **Spec §3.3 amended:** "Login accepts username or email" becomes "Login accepts the account email". No username field is added. Recorded in SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION as a deliberate amendment |
| D-22 (2026-09-23) | **Build own login/session history** (spec §3.3) | Added to V04 scope for commit 9: IP address and user-agent columns on `refresh_sessions` (migration), `GET /api/v1/auth/sessions` (own sessions only), and a self-service page. Moves from "not in scope" to "In V04" |
| D-23 (2026-09-23) | **Confirmed** the commit 5 implementation choices | Login attempt limits (5 per account / 20 per client per 15 min, configurable); account scope = linked employee's unit, unlinked accounts need system-wide scope; R5 windows 90/365 days (source: V03 reference, accepted by the owner); HR provisions accounts with an initial password until email invitations exist |
| D-24 (2026-09-23) | **Two-person approval for credential catalog changes only** (R10 "modifying global eligibility rules" = the hospital-wide catalog) | Creating or changing a credential type (grace days, expiry handling, tracked fields, activity, name, category) is queued; a **different system-wide** HR/System Admin approves and it executes as the approver. The request needs a reason (≥ 10 chars) and shows before → after; an approval is refused (`TEMPLATE_CHANGED_SINCE_REQUEST`) if the type changed after the request. Unit requirements apply immediately (existing audit + affected-employee count). The break-glass account applies catalog changes at once, as spec §3.6 exempts it from four-eyes |
| D-25 (2026-09-23) | **Credential catalog is hospital-wide only** | Only system-wide HR Admins / System Admins create or change credential types, and only they see catalog approval requests; unit-scoped HR manages requirements for their own units |
| D-26 (2026-09-23) | **No action on one's own credential** — all five blocked | Verify, approve renewal, reject renewal, suspend/revoke, and waive are refused when the credential belongs to the acting person, whatever their role |
| D-27 (2026-09-23) | **A nurse with no unit is blocked** (`UNIT_NOT_ASSIGNED`) | Spec §6.1 is silent; confirmed as the V04 rule |
| D-28 (2026-09-23) | **System Admins cannot issue waivers** (spec §6.1.2 literal) | Supervisor or HR Admin only. The break-glass account acts as System Admin, so it cannot issue waivers either |
| D-29 (2026-09-23) | **Contract transition map** | Draft → submit → PendingApproval → approve → Approved (future) / Active (covers today), or return → Draft. Approved/Active → suspend or terminate. Suspended → reinstate (Approved/Active by date, overlap re-checked). Terminated is final. Expired only by the daily job; Superseded not set by hand |
| D-30 (2026-09-23) | **A contract is approved by a different HR person** | The creator and the submitter cannot approve it (`SELF_APPROVAL_FORBIDDEN`); stored in the new `contracts.created_by_id` / `submitted_by_id` columns (migration `20260923120000_contract_actors`) |
| D-31 (2026-09-23) | **Shift times = V03's**: Morning 07:00–15:00, Evening 15:00–23:00, Night 23:00–07:00 (next day), Asia/Riyadh | Kept in one file (`backend/src/config/shifts.ts`) so they can change; used by attendance gaps |
| D-32 (2026-09-23) | **Home unit only** — no floating | A nurse is drafted and published only in their own unit: the engine checks the home unit's credential rules, so floating would skip the target unit's rules. A unit move demotes future published shifts. Floating needs an engine change first |
| D-33 (2026-09-23) | **Attendance: gap view now, badge feed later** | Events list and gap view built; the PACS ingest endpoint waits for its contract (auth, format, delivery — B-15) |
| D-34 (2026-09-23) | **Organisation structure is hospital-wide** — confirmed | Departments, unit create/move/deactivate, positions and the unit CSV import need system-wide HR/SA; unit-scoped HR manages bed counts and coverage targets for their units (the D-25 principle). No code change |
| D-35 (2026-09-23) | **Phone numbers: mobile + next-of-kin emergency contact** | New `employees.primary_phone` and `emergency_contact_phone` (migration `20260924090000_employee_phones`), E.164 — `+`, no leading zero, 8–15 digits; spaces, hyphens and brackets are removed before checking; a database CHECK repeats the rule. Any country code is accepted (expatriate staff and overseas next of kin). The employee updates both on their own record (`PATCH /employees/me/contact`, new **My Profile** page); HR maintains them too. The emergency number is a third person's data: seen by the employee and HR only, never in the Supervisor view, and its value is kept out of the audit trail (only "changed" is recorded). Implements the "own phone" item of spec §3.3 |
| D-36 (2026-09-23) | **Supervisor view (spec §8.1 "private fields suppressed")** | Shown: name, job number, unit, position, job title, specialty, status, hire date, **contact email, mobile phone, actual work place**. Hidden: salary, marital status, nationality, rank/grade, file number, job post location, emergency contact phone |
| D-37 (2026-09-23) | **No one acts on their own contract or deletes their own employee record** — confirmed (extension of D-26) | As built in commit 7 (`SELF_ACTION_FORBIDDEN`). **Basis cited by the owner:** CBAHI Human Resources Management standards (integrity of staff files and credentialing, conflict of interest); NCA Essential Cybersecurity Controls (identity and access management, segregation of duties, protected audit logs); MHRSD — Saudi Labor Law and digital employment contracts (Qiwa). The specific standard and control numbers are not held in this repository; the owner's compliance team should add them for audit reference |
| D-38 (2026-09-23) | **Early clock-in counts: 30 minutes** | A clock-in from 30 minutes before the shift start until its end marks the nurse present (gap view and missing alerts share `classifyShift`). **Spec §14.2 amended** (it counted only clock-ins at or after the start). Presence only — early-arrival pay rules belong to payroll, not this system |
| D-42 (2026-09-23) | **Database-first: no hospital data in code** (migration audit recommendations P1–P10, all approved) | P1 credential fields in a relational table; P2 roles and permissions stay in code; P3 beds stay a per-unit capacity with history; P4 rule E6 kept, served by the server; P5 no requirement versioning until policy U2; P6 one-time bootstrap of two administrators; P7 four-eyes baseline import, all-or-nothing, never overwriting; P8 categories editable with four-eyes; P9 demo data only as a development fixture; P10 `DATABASE_ARCHITECTURE.md` + `DATABASE_MIGRATION.md`. The seed is removed. Details: [DATABASE_MIGRATION.md](DATABASE_MIGRATION.md) |
| D-40 (2026-09-23) | **Nightly backup at 01:00 Asia/Riyadh (22:00 UTC)** — spec §10.6 | The kit's 02:00 host-clock schedule is corrected: the systemd timer names `Asia/Riyadh`; the crontab example has one line per host time zone |
| D-41 (2026-09-23) | **Contracts may be renewed before the current one ends** — spec §4.2 confirmed | The next period may be created and approved while the current contract still covers; the overlap rule (C4) keeps periods apart. V03's C7 is not used |
| D-39 (2026-09-23, revised the same day) | **Reminder schedule with escalation** | **Credentials:** window stays **60 days** (spec §5.2 unchanged); milestones 60, 30, 14, 7 days before the expiry date and once expired. **Contracts:** milestones 90, 30, 14, 7 days before the end date and once ended. (The owner first set 90 days for credentials, then corrected it to 60.) **Rule N2 overridden by the owner:** credentials go to the employee at 60 and 30, + unit Supervisor from 14, + scoped HR from 7 and at expiry; contracts (HR owns renewal) go to the employee and scoped HR from 90, + Supervisor from 14. Each run sends the current milestone only, so a late record or a missed run never produces a burst |
| D-43 (2026-09-24) | **Uploads are scanned synchronously; no quarantine queue** — spec §5.3.2 overridden | The owner signed off on keeping the in-request `clamd` scan as a deliberate deviation. The spec's asynchronous pipeline (`PENDING` → `SCANNING` → `CLEAN` / `INFECTED` / `SCAN_FAILED`, a quarantine area, a scan worker, `quarantine_scan_log`) is **not built**. **Owner's reasons:** (1) immediate feedback — the uploader sees a rejection at once instead of an "upload successful" that is later deleted unnoticed; (2) security — unscanned bytes never reach persistent storage, not even a quarantine folder; (3) fewer failure points — no worker that can crash and leave files stuck pending, which would block HR verification, and no schema additions. Files are capped at `UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE_BYTES` (10 MB), so the request-time scan is short. The spec's rules still hold: nothing unscanned is stored or served, infected files are not kept and are audited, scanner failures fail closed.

### Implementation notes — commit 5 (authentication and RBAC)

| Topic | What was built | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Timestamp bug found and fixed** | Prisma 7.10's pg adapter sends Dates without an offset; on a PostgreSQL server whose time zone is not UTC (e.g. Asia/Riyadh) every Prisma-written timestamp was stored 3 h early while `now()` was right. Every connection now pins `TimeZone=UTC` (`lib/prisma.ts`); a regression test forces an Asia/Riyadh connection. CI's UTC container could never have shown it | Fixed; affects every later commit |
| Login attempt limits | Per account and per client, fixed window, in memory (single API process) | Spec §3.3 requires limits but gives no numbers. Defaults 5/15 min per account, 20/15 min per client; configurable. **Confirmed by the owner (D-23)** |
| CSRF | Session-bound: `sha256(csrfToken)` is a claim in the access token; mutations compare the header to it and require the app `Origin`. Refresh (cookie-authenticated) uses Origin + double-submit cookie | Meets spec §3.4 without a schema change |
| Sessions (D-6) | 15 min access; refresh idle 1 h; absolute 24 h copied through every rotation; logout / password change / deactivation revoke the family so live access tokens stop at once | As decided |
| Password rule | 12–72 characters (spec §3.2) **and** ≤ 72 bytes UTF-8, because bcrypt ignores bytes beyond 72 (a long Arabic password would be silently truncated) | Byte limit is a technical necessity, not a policy |
| Accounts | HR provisions accounts with an initial password; the invitation/claim flow (spec §3.2) stays deferred until SMTP exists (§6). A scoped HR admin administers accounts whose linked employee is in scope; unlinked accounts need system-wide scope | **Confirmed (D-23)** |
| R5 expiry windows | 90 days SUPERVISOR, 365 others | Source is the V03 NestJS reference, not the spec — **accepted by the owner (D-23)** |
| PAM | Reason ≥ 10 chars, 1–4 h, default 2 h (V03 reference values; spec says "e.g., 2 hours") | Expired elevations are ignored at once; cleanup job in commit 9 |
| Break-glass (D-9) | Siren on successful sign-in of the flagged account: irrevocable event, HIGH audit, CRITICAL in-app notification to System Admins; root access without PAM/four-eyes; session and access end at 4 h. Failed attempts on it are audited HIGH | SMS/email to CEO + IT Director not built (no SMTP/SMS) |
| Workforce reads | `GET /departments`, `GET /units` brought forward from commit 7 (the role-assignment scope picker needs them); read-only | Writes stay in commit 7 |

**Commit 5 validation (2026-09-23)** found and fixed five defects, each reproduced by a failing test first: logout lacked the CSRF check (spec §3.4 "all state-changing requests"); login lacked an Origin check (login CSRF); deactivating an account could remove the last System Admin, bypassing R8; R8 counted assignments held by deactivated accounts; an administrator could re-link their own account to another employee. API responses now also carry `Cache-Control: no-store`.

### Implementation notes — commit 6 (credentials and clinical eligibility)

| Topic | What was built | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Template PATCH defect | A partial update filled omitted fields with their create defaults (`.partial()` keeps zod defaults), so changing grace days also cleared the tracked fields | Found while building D-24; fixed and covered by a test |
| Engine | `modules/eligibility/engine.ts`, pure: spec §6.1 order; D-4 (no rules → ELIGIBLE + `NO_REQUIREMENTS_CONFIGURED`); D-15 (dates checked against the evaluated day; waiver per template); §5.1.4 position-specific rule overrides unit-wide; grace §6.1.1; transitions §6.1.1.1; 33 unit tests from the acceptance tables, mutation-checked | As specified |
| New status | `ELIGIBLE_WITH_POLICY_WARNING` added (spec §6.1.1.1 names it; the consolidated schema lacked it). Migration `20260923060000_credential_review_and_policy_warning` also adds `document_versions.review_status` and `credentials.latest_evidence_id` (spec §5.1.5) | Schema gap closed |
| Materialized state | Refreshed inside the transaction of every credential, requirement, template and waiver change (L6); status changes audited | Date passage (expiries, waiver ends, deadlines) and stored-status transitions (Valid → ExpiringSoon → Expired) need the daily job — **commit 9**. The engine checks dates itself, so eligibility is never wrong in the meantime; only the stored snapshot and the stored credential status can lag |
| Grace log | Grace activation/completion/closure are HIGH audit events, as DATABASE_CONSOLIDATION decided — no separate `grace_period_log` table (the spec's acceptance wording names one) | Deviation, documented |
| Grace no-stacking | A grace window is tied to one expiry cycle (`graceCycleId`); approval clears it; rejection or suspension/revocation closes it so re-submitting cannot reopen it | Conservative reading of "no stacking" |
| Uploads (D-10) | Magic-byte + size checks; development marks CLEAN; downloads CLEAN-only and audited. **Production refuses to start** (`UPLOAD_SCANNER`) until a ClamAV adapter exists | As decided in D-10. **2026-09-24:** ClamAV adapter built — synchronous `clamd` scan before storage, no quarantine queue (**D-43**); production requires `UPLOAD_SCANNER=clamav` ([DEPLOYMENT.md §2.1](DEPLOYMENT.md#21-malware-scanner-clamav)) |
| Unassigned employee | No unit → no rule can apply → **blocked** (`UNIT_NOT_ASSIGNED`) rather than cleared without any credential check | **Confirmed (D-27)** |
| Separation of duties | Nobody verifies, suspends, revokes or decides the renewal of their own credential, or waives their own credential | **Confirmed (D-26)** |
| Catalog scope | Only system-wide HR/System Admins change templates (one hospital catalog); scoped HR manages rules for their units | **Confirmed (D-25)** |
| Waiver authority | Spec §6.1.2 read literally: Supervisor or HR Admin only; **System Admin receives 403** | **Confirmed (D-28)** |
| Transition deadline | Judged against today (spec: `CURRENT_DATE`), not the shift date | Spec literal |
| R10 "modifying global eligibility rules" | Four-eyes on every credential-type (catalog) change; unit requirements apply immediately | **Decided (D-24)** — built as a follow-up to commit 6 |

### Implementation notes — commit 7 (workforce, employees, contracts)

| Topic | What was built | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Organisation scope | Departments, unit create/move/deactivate, positions and CSV import need **system-wide** HR/SA; bed counts and coverage targets follow **unit scope**; bed history is readable by scoped Supervisors | **Confirmed — D-34** |
| W1–W8 | Deactivation guards (W1, W2, W6); beds 0–500 with reason and one log row per change (W4); bulk per-row results committed together (W5); schedulability change re-evaluates holders; coverage target `null` = unspecified (W8) | As specified |
| CSV import | V03 kit behaviour (dry run default, never deletes) plus RFC 4180 quoting, BOM handling and case-insensitive code matching (V03 split on every comma) | Improved port |
| Onboarding | Employee + Draft contract + HIGH audit + eligibility state in one transaction (D-3, D-17); Hijri dates converted by the server, not taken from the browser | As decided |
| Supervisor private fields | The spec says "private fields suppressed" without a list. Commit 7 suppressed contact email and actual work place too | **Decided — D-36** (contact email, mobile and work place now shown; built in commit 10b) |
| Own contract / own record | Nobody creates, renews, transitions or uploads to their **own** contract, or deletes their own employee record (`SELF_ACTION_FORBIDDEN`) — the D-26 principle applied to contracts | **Confirmed — D-37** |
| Renewal timing (C7 vs spec §4.2) — **decided D-41** | V03 (`contracts.ts:130-147`, rule C7) allowed renewal only after all Approved/Active coverage had ended, which forces a gap between contracts. Spec §4.2 says an Approved future period may sit next to the current one ("approval does not supersede the current contract"; C12). **V04 follows the spec:** renewal is allowed any time; the approval overlap check (C4) and the database constraint prevent overlap | **Owner to confirm** |
| C11 contract copy | V03 required the PDF on the create form. V04 creates the Draft first and requires a CLEAN copy before **submit** — the copy is still mandatory before approval | Same rule, different step |
| Own phone update (spec §3.3) | Not built in commit 7: the employee schema had no phone column | **Decided — D-35**, built in commit 10b |
| KPI (D-11) | Ported engine; response and page state that the Ada'a card is not in the repository. Unit → area map is V03's (by unit code). Beds count **active** units only (V03 counted inactive critical units in KPI A) | Kept per D-11; thresholds unverified |
| Stored status lag | Approved → Active at start date and Active → Expired at end date need the daily job (commit 9). The engine treats Approved and Active alike for coverage (C12), so eligibility is correct meanwhile | Same pattern as commit 6 |

### Implementation notes — commit 8 (scheduling and attendance)

| Topic | What was built | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Who schedules (D-14) | Only scoped Supervisors draft, auto-fill, cancel and publish; HR / System Admin read the board and coverage | As decided |
| Live eligibility (L7) | Board, pool, auto-fill and publish all run the engine for the shift date; facts are loaded once per nurse per request | As specified |
| Publication (S3, L8) | One transaction, advisory lock per unit; INELIGIBLE stays Draft with reasons; grace/waiver reliance stored on the assignment, returned and audited | As specified |
| Revalidation (§6.2) | Built into `refreshEligibility`, so every change that refreshes a nurse re-checks their future published shifts; invalid → Draft + HIGH audit + supervisor notice | As specified. Date passage (a credential expiring tomorrow) needs the daily job — **commit 9** |
| Auto-fill | V03 filled to the removed bed formula (D-16); V04 fills to configured targets only. **Heuristics, not policy:** one auto-filled shift per nurse per day, fewest shifts first. Manual drafting can still give a nurse two shifts in a day (only S1 applies) | Rest/fatigue rules **REQUIREMENT NOT ESTABLISHED** |
| Past dates | Drafting and publishing refuse shift dates before today | Implementation safeguard |
| Coverage | Eligible, non-cancelled assignments counted per status; shortage = target − published eligible; never blocks (S4) | As specified |
| Early clock-in | Spec §14.2's query counted only clock-ins **at or after** the shift start, so a nurse who badged in at 06:50 for 07:00 showed as MISSING | **Decided — D-38** (30 minutes; built in commit 10b) |
| Gap alerts | On-demand view only; the 15-minute worker and "Critical Coverage Alert" push are **commit 9** | Planned |
| API map correction | §2.10 said "after 15 min"; the spec says 30 minutes. The map now says 30 | Corrected |

### Implementation notes — commit 9 (notifications, audit, jobs, own sessions)

| Topic | What was built | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Scheduler | One minute tick; each period is a unique `job_runs.run_key` (completed once, failed/stuck retried up to 5 attempts, missed days run on next start — N4); `worker_leases` stops two processes running one job | Spec §10.3 lease + run history. `JOBS_MODE=in-process` (default, development), `worker` for production with `npm run worker`, `off` |
| Daily transition | Everything date-driven that commits 6–8 left to "the daily job": contract and credential statuses, grace closure (+ HR notice), PAM and break-glass expiry, idempotency purge, full eligibility refresh (which demotes invalid future published shifts) | As specified. First run on the dev data corrected the three V03 credentials stored as Valid with past expiry dates |
| Reminder milestones | Spec §7.1 names the event key (record + expiry date + milestone) but not the milestones. Commit 9 sent one notice on entering the window and one on credential expiry | **Decided — D-39** (built in commit 10b) |
| Email | Notifications are stored with `emailStatus = SKIPPED`: SMTP is not decided (spec §7.2 worker not built); unregistered employees receive nothing yet | Deferred with SMTP |
| Coverage alerts | Spec §14.2 "push notification" is an in-app CRITICAL notice to the unit's supervisors; suppression is provable (one per assignment via the unique event key) | Push channel not built |
| Role expiry | Expired role assignments stop working at once (queries filter on `expiresAt`); no separate "expired" audit row is written | As built in commit 5 |
| Audit reading | System Admin only (D-20), search + chain verification; HR audit access still **REQUIREMENT NOT ESTABLISHED** | As decided |
| Own session history (D-22) | `refresh_sessions.ip_address` / `user_agent` (migration `20260923180000_session_meta_and_job_runs`), `GET /auth/sessions`, Sign-in history page | Done |

### Implementation notes — commit 10 (tests against the Phase 15 matrix)

Totals after commit 10: **backend 260 tests / 17 files** (unit + integration against PostgreSQL), **frontend 20 tests / 4 files**. Every new test file was mutation-checked: a deliberate break of the rule it guards made it fail.

| Phase 15 item | Where it is tested | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Nurse creation | `scenarios.test.ts` §1; `workforce.test.ts` onboarding | Covered |
| Credential management | `scenarios` §2; `credentials.test.ts` | Covered |
| Eligibility | `engine.test.ts` (33, acceptance tables); `scenarios` §1–7 | Covered |
| Expired licence | `scenarios` §7 (daily job → Expired → INELIGIBLE → published shift back to draft → supervisor notice) | Covered |
| Missing credential | `scenarios` §2, §5–6 (blocked at publish; per-template waiver) | Covered |
| Training requirement | `scenarios` §3 (TRANSITION warning → policy notice → block after deadline) | Covered |
| Staffing target / coverage | `scenarios` §4–7; `scheduling.test.ts` | Covered |
| Assignment / roster | `scenarios` §4–6; `scheduling.test.ts` | Covered |
| Attendance gap | `scenarios` §8; `scheduling.test.ts`; `jobs.test.ts` | Covered |
| Break-glass | `scenarios` §9; `auth.test.ts` | Covered |
| Audit trail | `scenarios` §10 (every step's action present, chain intact); `database-constraints.test.ts` A2/A3 | Covered for the scenario path; there is no generic "every mutation writes a row" test |
| DB constraints (overlap, 72 h waiver, bed range, duplicate job number, double booking) | `database-constraints.test.ts` | Covered |
| RBAC matrix per role | `route-matrix.test.ts`: every registered route × 5 personas matches `permissions.ts`; every non-public route 401 without a token; ungated routes must be on a reviewed own-or-scoped list; no unused permission | Covered — new routes are included automatically |
| Auth, CSRF on refresh, hashing, rotation/reuse | `auth.test.ts`, `rbac.test.ts` | Covered |
| No PII in logs | `logging.test.ts` (email, password, names, salary, query text) | Covered for request logging; error logs include exception messages (`describeError`) — acceptable for driver errors, which carry column names, not values |
| No unscoped reads | per-module scope tests and the sweeps in `credentials`, `workforce`, `scheduling` tests | Covered |
| Frontend imports / routes | `modules.test.tsx` (registry; every page module loads); `i18n.test.ts` (every used key and enum-driven key family exists in en and ar, none empty) | Covered. No component/DOM tests (no jsdom dependency added) |

### Implementation notes — commit 10b (owner decisions D-34…D-39)

| Area | What was built | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Phones (D-35) | Migration `20260924090000_employee_phones` (two nullable `VARCHAR(16)` columns + CHECK constraints). HR onboarding and edit accept both; `PATCH /employees/me/contact` accepts only these two fields (strict body), audited as `EMPLOYEE_CONTACT_UPDATED` with the next-of-kin value redacted. Frontend: phone fields in the HR form, **My Profile** page (employees only) | Built; tests in `workforce.test.ts`, `lib/phone.test.ts` |
| Supervisor view (D-36) | `baselineView` adds contact email, mobile and actual work place; the test lists every hidden field | Built |
| Early clock-in (D-38) | `EARLY_CLOCK_IN_MINUTES = 30` in `attendance/service.ts`; the gap response carries `earlyClockInMinutes`. A clock-in at 06:30 counts for 07:00, 06:29 does not | Built; tests in `scheduling.test.ts` (edge) and `jobs.test.ts` (alert suppressed) |
| Reminders (D-39) | `RENEWAL_WINDOW_DAYS = 60` (unchanged); `jobs/expiry-scan.ts` rewritten around per-kind `MILESTONES` (credentials 60/30/14/7, contracts 90/30/14/7) and a `ROUTING` table. Event keys `…:within-60/30/14/7` (credentials), `…:within-90/30/14/7` (contracts) and `…:expired`; contract end notices are new ("Contract ended") | Built; tests in `jobs.test.ts` (milestone table, routing per audience, idempotency, time travel) |
| **Implementation choice** — renewed contracts | A contract whose employee already has a later Approved or Active contract gets no reminder (the renewal is secured). Without it HR and the nurse would be told a contract "ended" after it was renewed | **Confirmed by the owner 2026-09-23** |
| **Implementation choice** — Supervisor on contracts | The owner set "the same 90/30/14/7/0 cadence" for contracts with HR from day 90; Supervisors are added from day 14 as for credentials | **Confirmed by the owner 2026-09-23** |
| One-time effect on deployment | Commit 9 used one key per window (`within-60` credentials, `within-90` contracts). A record still in its first milestone keeps that key and is not notified again; a record already inside 30/14/7 days gets its current milestone once. Contracts already ended with no later contract get one "Contract ended" notice | Expected |
| "Action required" visibility | The header bell with the unread count is on every page (commit 9). No separate dashboard widget was added | As built |
| Test-data fix | The contract renewal test now reads the renewal picker (max 500 rows) through HR scoped to a unit of its own; the shared test database had grown past 500 employees | Test only; the 500-row cap is noted for commit 11 |

Totals after commit 10b: backend **281 tests / 17 files**, frontend **31 tests / 5 files**; each new rule mutation-checked (HR at 30 days, a 90-day credential window, contract HR from 90 removed, renewal suppression removed, early window removed, next-of-kin shown to Supervisor, next-of-kin not redacted — each made a test fail).

### Implementation notes — commit 11 (documentation)

| Topic | What was done | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Doc set | `SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION`, `ARCHITECTURE`, `RBAC`, `CLINICAL_ELIGIBILITY`, `WORKFORCE`, `API` (renamed from `API_MAP`), `DATABASE`, `DEPLOYMENT`, `MIGRATION`, plus the `docs/README.md` index | Done |
| Guards against drift | `scripts/check-docs.mjs` (`npm run docs:check`, part of `npm test` and CI): every relative link and heading anchor must resolve. `backend/test/docs.test.ts`: RBAC.md §3 must equal `permissions.ts`. Both mutation-checked | Done |
| Found by the link check | `ops/backup/README.md` linked to `#defects-found-by-running-this-kit`; GitHub's anchor is `#6-defects-found-by-running-this-kit` | Fixed |
| Found while writing | `API.md` said `/health` returns `{status, db}`; it returns `{status, database}` and 503 when the database is down | Fixed |
| **Production cannot start** | `assertUploadScanner` refuses both scanner values in production (D-10 as decided): the API will not start with `NODE_ENV=production` until a ClamAV adapter exists | Recorded in DEPLOYMENT.md §6 — by design, but now stated plainly. **2026-09-24:** the ClamAV adapter is built; production starts with `UPLOAD_SCANNER=clamav` ([DEPLOYMENT.md §2.1](DEPLOYMENT.md#21-malware-scanner-clamav)) |
| **Database roles not written** | Plan §2 / DATABASE_CONSOLIDATION §5 promised `ops/db/grants.sql` (spec §10.7); it does not exist. The audit table is append-only by trigger regardless | Recorded as a production gap (DEPLOYMENT.md §6, MIGRATION.md B-05). **2026-09-24:** written as `ops/db/01_roles.sql` + `02_grants.sql` (instead of one `grants.sql`), tested in CI |
| Backup time (spec vs kit) | Spec §10.6: nightly backup 22:00 UTC (01:00 Riyadh). Kit `crontab.example` / `aigh-backup.timer`: 02:00 "Riyadh" on the host clock (05:00 Riyadh on a UTC host) | **Decided — D-40** (01:00 Riyadh; files corrected) |
| Prisma CLI advisories | `npm audit`: 4 high in the Prisma CLI's bundled `mysql2` / `deepmerge-ts`; the runtime API does not load them; npm's fix downgrades to Prisma 6 | Not applied; mitigation in DEPLOYMENT.md §6 |
| Renewal picker cap | `GET /contracts/renewable` returns at most 500 in-scope employees without search | Recorded (WORKFORCE.md §3, DEPLOYMENT.md §6) |

### Implementation notes — commit 12 (cleanup and validation)

Recorded in full in [CLEANUP_REPORT.md](CLEANUP_REPORT.md): dead code removed with usage evidence (`ModulePlaceholder`, `readableUnits`, two translation keys), `noUnusedLocals` enabled, four stage-1 reports moved to `docs/history/` (`FEATURE_MASTER_INVENTORY.md` kept — its rule register is cited by an applied migration), `.env.example` test-database comment corrected, decision dates D-34 … D-41 corrected to 2026-09-23, and the complete validation matrix (install, type check, build, migrations, drift, seed, start, worker, production guards, 282 backend + 31 frontend tests, bundle, documentation links) — all green except the documented production gaps.

### Implementation notes — database-first migration (D-42)

Recorded in [DATABASE_MIGRATION.md](DATABASE_MIGRATION.md): commits `d0f5c1b` … cleanup, tag `pre-db-first` as the rollback point. The §2 layout above still shows the original `seed.ts` / `seed-data/` design; the current layout is in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Proposals received with the D-24…D-28 decisions — not adopted yet

The owner's notes for D-24…D-28 also suggested features beyond those decisions. None is specified, so each is **REQUIREMENT NOT ESTABLISHED** until the owner schedules it:

| Proposal | Note |
| :--- | :--- |
| Route a lone HR Admin's own credential to hospital-wide HR automatically | Today any other in-scope HR Admin or a System Admin can act; there is no routing engine |
| Employee "report status change" button (self-report → under review, pause shifts, HR ticket) | New workflow; needs definition of the "under review" effect on eligibility |
| In-app "request a new credential type" form for unit HR | New workflow; D-25 currently means asking hospital-wide HR outside the app |
| Primary-source verification APIs, HRIS sync | The examples given (Nursys, US state boards, AHA, Workday) are US systems; the Saudi equivalent would be SCFHS. No integration is specified |
| SMS / e-mail expiry reminders at 90/60/30/14 days | The **in-app** schedule is now decided (D-39: credentials 60/30/14/7/0, contracts 90/30/14/7/0). SMTP/SMS stay deferred — the owner confirmed on 2026-09-23 |
| E-mail alerts to CNO / HR Director / IT Security on break-glass use | Break-glass already sounds an in-app CRITICAL alert to System Admins (R18); named recipients and e-mail are not specified |

## 9. Decisions required before stage 2

Each row names the conflict it resolves, my recommendation, and the consequence. **Nothing below is assumed. Stage 2 starts only once these are answered.**

| ID | Question | Options | Recommendation | Consequence of recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **D-1** | Keep the standalone (no-backend) demo mode? | Keep / remove | **Remove** | Removes the second copy of every rule; a demo needs `docker compose up` |
| **D-2** | Where does V04 live? | New GitHub repo `nurse_appV04` / branch in V03 | **New repo**; tag V03 `v03-final` and leave V03 read-only as the archive | Clean history; V03 remains the historical record. Creating the GitHub repo is your action or needs your go-ahead |
| **D-3** (C-1) | Contract created by onboarding | **Approved** (spec §3.1, atomic contract-first) / **Draft** (V03 since `bb8ecfd`) | Your call. If Draft: amend spec §3.1 in `SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md` | Approved: onboarded nurse can be eligible immediately. Draft: HR approval step first, nurse ineligible until then |
| **D-4** (C-2) | Eligibility when no requirement is configured | Block (spec + U2 pack) / eligible (V03 behaviour) | **Block** (spec's explicit safety rule) | Until the U2 credential policy is signed, every nurse in a unit/position without rules is INELIGIBLE. Demo seed must include illustrative requirements |
| **D-5** (C-8) | `DEVELOPER` full-access role | Keep / remove | **Remove.** Seed one demo user per role instead | Four-eyes, PAM and separation of duties cannot be bypassed |
| **D-6** (C-10) | Session lifetimes | Spec: 1 h validity, 24 h absolute / V03: 15 min access + 7 d refresh | **15 min access token, 1 h idle, 24 h absolute** (satisfies spec) | Users re-login daily |
| **D-7** (C-12) | Audit hash formula | gate1 (unstored timestamp) / backend JSON / new | **SQL function hashing stored columns incl. `created_at`** | Chain linkage *and* content verifiable |
| **D-8** (C-13) | Id type | Int / UUID | **Int autoincrement** (running system, spec SQL, gate1, "numeric account identifiers" §3.3) | Matches all executed code; non-guessable ids are not a spec requirement |
| **D-9** | Break-glass depth in V04 | None / minimal / full | **Minimal:** dedicated account flag, activation writes `break_glass_events` + HIGH audit + CRITICAL in-app notification to SA users, session hard-capped at 4 h. SMS/email to CEO + IT Director **not** built until SMTP/SMS decided | Rule R18 partially met; documented gap |
| **D-10** | Upload scanning without ClamAV | Keep V03 simulation (magic bytes → CLEAN) in dev only / require ClamAV | **Dev: magic-byte check marks CLEAN; production config refuses to start without a scanner** | D4 honoured in production; dev usable |
| **D-11** (K1) | Ada'a KPI thresholds | Keep with a source citation / remove | **Keep only if you can provide the MoH Ada'a indicator card** (reference into `docs/WORKFORCE.md`) | Otherwise the KPI page is removed |
| **D-12** | Shared code package | none / `shared/` workspace | **None** (see §2) | Two ~30-line display helpers exist in both packages, documented |
| **D-13** | Runtime versions | Spec: Node 20 / PG 15 | **Node 22 LTS, PostgreSQL 15** | Spec §0.2/§11.4 amended for Node |
| **D-14** (C-9) | Who drafts and publishes rosters | Spec: scoped Supervisor; HR read by default / V03: HR only | **Spec** | HR needs a Supervisor assignment to publish |
| **D-15** (C-3, C-4) | Waiver and credential-date semantics | Spec / V03 live engine | **Spec** (per-template waiver; dates checked against shift date) | Some V03 demo nurses change eligibility |
| **D-16** (C-5) | Staffing requirement formula `beds × 0.14/0.11/0.10` | Keep as default / remove | **Remove.** Coverage targets are entered per unit/shift; absent = "unspecified" | Roster shows "target not set" until HR configures targets |
| **D-17** | Onboarding atomicity mechanism | Spec: SECURITY DEFINER SQL function + runtime INSERT revoked / Prisma transaction | **Prisma interactive transaction** (brief: Prisma is the authoritative access layer); DB constraints still enforce uniqueness/overlap | Deviation from spec's "Bulletproof Rule" wording; documented in SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION |
| **D-18** (C-7) | Requirement nulls | null = all units / unit required | **null = all** for both unit and position | HR can express hospital-wide rules |
| **D-19** (C-16) | Unique contact email | yes / no | **No** (not established) | — |
| **D-20** | Audit read access for HR | SA only / HR scoped | Not established. **SA only** until decided | HR cannot browse audit |
