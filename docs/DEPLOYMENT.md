# Deployment and operations

How to run V04 and what must be settled before production. Two production layouts are built, both with releases through GitHub Actions and a manual approval. **The single VPS is the chosen one (D-57)**; the Google Cloud layout stays in the repository as an alternative, tested locally but not provisioned:

- **A single VPS (D-57)** — Ubuntu 24.04, PostgreSQL 15 on the host, the API, worker, web server and ClamAV as containers, Caddy for HTTPS, blue/green releases with no dropped requests: [ops/vps/README.md](../ops/vps/README.md). The server must be in a data centre **in the Kingdom** (spec §8.3.6) — Hostinger has none, so it can serve staging with synthetic data only.
- **Google Cloud, Dammam (`me-central2`, D-49) — alternative, not chosen** — two Compute Engine VMs behind a regional HTTPS load balancer: [ops/gcp/README.md](../ops/gcp/README.md). Its **Deploy** workflow skips itself while the `GCP_PROJECT` variable is unset.

This guide covers the settings, jobs, database, backups and monitoring that apply however the processes are run.

> **Production prerequisites are still open.** With `NODE_ENV=production` the API starts only with `UPLOAD_SCANNER=clamav` and a reachable `CLAMAV_HOST` configured (D-10, [§2.1](#21-malware-scanner-clamav)); [§6](#6-known-gaps-before-production) lists what else must be settled first.

## 1. Requirements

| Component | Version / note |
| :--- | :--- |
| Node.js | 22 LTS or newer (`engines` in `package.json`; CI uses 22) |
| PostgreSQL | 15 (extensions `btree_gist`, `pgcrypto` — created by the first migration) |
| Reverse proxy | TLS termination; serves the frontend and forwards `/api/v1` to the API on the **same origin** (the refresh cookie, CSRF and `Origin` checks assume it) |
| ClamAV | `clamd` 1.x reachable over TCP from the API, ≥ 2 GB RAM, signatures updated by `freshclam` (spec §5.3.2). See §2.1 |
| Hosting | Inside the Kingdom (spec §8.3). The API and worker refuse to start outside the configured KSA region allowlist |

## 2. Configuration

Every backend setting is in [`.env.example`](../.env.example) and is validated at start-up (`backend/src/config/env.ts`); a bad value stops the process with a clear message.

| Setting | Default | Production note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `NODE_ENV` | development | `production` |
| `PORT` | 3001 | Behind the proxy |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | http://localhost:5173 | The public app origin |
| `DATABASE_URL` | — | Required. In production the `nurseapp_runtime` login ([ops/db](../ops/db/README.md)) |
| `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` | — (falls back to `DATABASE_URL`) | The `nurseapp_migration` login; read only by `prisma migrate deploy`, set only where releases run |
| `JWT_SECRET` | — | Required, ≥ 32 characters of random data (spec §3.4). Rotating it signs everyone out |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS` / `SESSION_IDLE_SECONDS` / `SESSION_ABSOLUTE_SECONDS` | 900 / 3600 / 86400 | D-6 |
| `BCRYPT_ROUNDS` | 12 | 10–15 |
| `MFA_REQUIRED_ROLES` | SYSTEM_ADMIN,HR_ADMIN,SUPERVISOR | Holders must use an authenticator app (spec §3.5, D-51). Production refuses a list without `SYSTEM_ADMIN` and `HR_ADMIN` |
| `MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | — (development derives one) | **Required in production:** 32 random bytes, base64 (`openssl rand -base64 32`). Encrypts the authenticator secrets; keep it in the deployment secrets **and** with the backup keys — a restore without it means every authenticator is set up again (HR resets each) |
| `LOGIN_THROTTLE_WINDOW_SECONDS` / `_MAX_PER_ACCOUNT` / `_MAX_PER_CLIENT` | 900 / 5 / 20 | D-23. Counted in the database (`login_throttle`, D-46), so they hold across any number of API instances and restarts |
| `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` | 30 | Days a backup is kept — set it to the same value as the backup kit's `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` (spec §10.6). An erasure record (D-55) states when the last backup holding the erased data expires: erasure time + this + 1 day |
| `STORAGE_DIR` | ./storage | Persistent, backed-up volume; never served directly. Holds the document vault's **encrypted** objects (D-53) — back it up with the database, and restore both from the same night |
| `PDPL_FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` / `PDPL_BLIND_INDEX_PEPPER` | — (development derives them) | **Required in production** (D-54): two more `openssl rand -base64 32` values, different from each other and from the MFA and document keys. The first wraps each employee's key for Iqama, passport and SCFHS numbers — without it those values cannot be read; the second keys the number search. Keep both with the backup keys |
| `DOCUMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | — (development derives one) | **Required in production:** 32 random bytes, base64 (`openssl rand -base64 32`), different from `MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Wraps every document's own key; without it no stored document can be read — keep it in the deployment secrets **and** with the backup keys |
| `UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE_BYTES` | 10485760 | Spec §5.1.5 |
| `UPLOAD_SCANNER` | dev-magic-bytes | `clamav` — production refuses anything else (D-10, §2.1) |
| `CLAMAV_HOST` / `CLAMAV_PORT` | — / 3310 | The `clamd` TCP endpoint; the host is required with `clamav` |
| `CLAMAV_TIMEOUT_MS` | 30000 | Per `clamd` call (spec §5.3.2) |
| `CLAMAV_MAX_SIGNATURE_AGE_HOURS` | 48 | Older signatures log `clamav signatures are stale` (spec §5.3.2 rule 7) |
| `SMTP_HOST` / `SMTP_PORT` / `SMTP_SECURE` | — / 587 / false | The hospital relay (D-47); empty = e-mail off. STARTTLS is required on 587; `true` for implicit TLS on 465 (§2.2) |
| `SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASS` | — | The relay's service account; the password from the deployment secrets |
| `SMTP_FROM` / `SMTP_REPLY_TO` | — | Sender (required with `SMTP_HOST`) and a monitored HR mailbox |
| `SMTP_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` | true | Verify the relay certificate; `false` is refused in production |
| `SMTP_RETRY_MAX` / `SMTP_RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS` | 8 / 60 | Spec §7.2 |
| `APP_BASE_URL` | `CORS_ORIGIN` | The public app URL used in e-mail links |
| `BREAK_GLASS_ALERT_EMAILS` | — | Comma-separated: the CEO and IT Director (spec §3.6) |
| `NOTIFICATION_DRIVER` | mock | `mock` keeps Telegram messages in the Dev Console Telegram inbox and sends nothing (§2.3, D-66); `telegram` sends through the Telegram Bot API |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` / `TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME` | — | Required with `NOTIFICATION_DRIVER=telegram`: the bot's token (a secret, from the deployment secrets) and username (without `@`) from @BotFather |
| `TELEGRAM_UPDATES` | polling | How the bot receives `/start` (account linking): `polling` — the jobs process (API in development, worker in production) long-polls Telegram, no public address needed; `webhook` — the API registers `APP_BASE_URL/api/v1/telegram/webhook` at start-up |
| `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | — | Required with `TELEGRAM_UPDATES=webhook`: at least 32 of `A–Z a–z 0–9 _ -` (`openssl rand -hex 32`); Telegram sends it back with every call and anything else is refused |
| `SCFHS_DRIVER` | mock | `mock` answers licence checks from the simulated SCFHS registry in the Dev Console (§2.4, D-64); `live` is the SCFHS verification API (not built yet) |
| `SCFHS_API_URL` / `SCFHS_API_KEY` | — | Required with `SCFHS_DRIVER=live`: the SCFHS endpoint and key from the SCFHS agreement (U3) |
| `BADGE_SIMULATOR` | off in production, on elsewhere | `on` lets a System Admin write simulated badge events from the Dev Console (§2.5, D-65). Turn it on in production only for a demonstration, then clear the events and turn it off |
| `BREAK_GLASS_ALERT_TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS` | — | Comma-separated Telegram chat ids: messaged when the break-glass account signs in (spec §3.6). Each person must have started a chat with the bot first |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | false | `true` behind the proxy, so login limits and session history see the client address |
| `JOBS_MODE` | in-process | `worker` on the API in production (§3) |
| `DATA_RESIDENCY_REGION` / `PDPL_ALLOWED_REGIONS` | local / local | A KSA region id and its allowlist; `local` is refused in production. Never `me-south-1` (Bahrain) or `me-central-1` (UAE) |
| `MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS` · `DOCUMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS` · `PDPL_FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS` · `PDPL_BLIND_INDEX_PEPPER_PREVIOUS` | — | Only while rotating that key (B-18, [§5 Rotating a key](#rotating-a-key)): the key being replaced, beside the new one. Refused without the new key, and in production when equal to any other key |
| `DEMO_PASSWORD` | — | Development fixtures only (`npm run fixtures:demo`); never set in production |

### 2.1 Malware scanner (ClamAV)

Every upload (credential evidence and contract copies) goes: size and type checks → magic bytes → **`clamd` scan** → storage → database row. The API streams the bytes to `clamd` with `INSTREAM` inside the upload request (`backend/src/lib/scanner.ts`), so a file is written to `STORAGE_DIR` only after `clamd` reports it clean:

| `clamd` result | Response | What is kept |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `OK` | 201; document `CLEAN`; the `DOCUMENT_UPLOADED` audit names the engine and signature version | File and row |
| `… FOUND` | 422 `UPLOAD_INFECTED` | **Nothing stored.** A HIGH audit entry `DOCUMENT_REJECTED_INFECTED` (file name, size, SHA-256, signature) and an error log line `malware detected in upload` |
| Error, timeout, unreachable, or **no signature database loaded** | Retried — 3 attempts in total — then 503 `SCANNER_UNAVAILABLE` | Nothing stored; error log `upload scan failed; upload refused`. The user uploads again later |

**Deliberate deviation from the spec — owner decision [D-43](V04_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md#9a-decision-record-2026-09-23).** Spec §5.3.2 describes an asynchronous quarantine queue (`PENDING` → `SCANNING` → `CLEAN` / `INFECTED` / `SCAN_FAILED`, a quarantine area and a scan worker). It is not built and should not be: the uploader gets an immediate answer instead of a later silent deletion, unscanned bytes never reach persistent storage, and there is no worker that could crash and leave files stuck pending. With files capped at `UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE_BYTES` the synchronous scan meets the spec's rules — nothing unscanned is stored or served, infected files are not kept, every rejection is audited.

**Operating `clamd`:**

- Run `clamd` on a host the API reaches (a separate host or container is fine; nothing else should reach port 3310). For a local trial: `docker compose --profile clamav up -d clamav`.
- `StreamMaxLength` in `clamd.conf` must be at least `UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE_BYTES` (clamd's default is 25 MB; the upload limit is 10 MB).
- `freshclam` must update the signatures at least daily; it needs outbound HTTPS to the ClamAV mirrors (or a hospital mirror). Signatures that are only old (older than `CLAMAV_MAX_SIGNATURE_AGE_HOURS`) do not stop uploads, but every scan logs an error until they are refreshed — alert on it (§7). A `clamd` with **no** official signature database (its `VERSION` reply has no database number) is treated as misconfigured: uploads are refused with `SCANNER_UNAVAILABLE`, because such a scanner reports almost everything as clean.
- **Go-live check** — from the API host, before enabling uploads: [`ops/clamav/go-live-check.sh`](../ops/clamav/go-live-check.sh) `clamav.internal 3310`. It talks to `clamd` the way the API does (bash only, no `clamdscan` or `nc`) and exits non-zero unless all five checks pass:

  | Check | Passes when | Typical fix when it fails |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | Reachable | `PING` → `PONG` | Firewall between the API and the scanner host, host name or port |
  | Signatures | `VERSION` carries a database number, dated within 24 h (`CHECK_MAX_AGE_HOURS`) | Run / enable `freshclam`; allow its outbound HTTPS or configure the internal mirror |
  | Detection | The standalone EICAR file is `FOUND` under an official name — no `.UNOFFICIAL` suffix | The official database is not loaded (see Signatures) |
  | Clean | A small PDF → `OK` | — |
  | Size limit | A file of `UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE_BYTES` → `OK` | Raise `StreamMaxLength` in `clamd.conf` |

  Then upload one real document through the app and confirm it is accepted. (A PDF with the EICAR string inside it may or may not be flagged by the official signatures, which match the standalone test file; the rejection path itself is covered by the automated tests.)

### 2.2 E-mail (hospital SMTP relay)

Every in-app notification is also e-mailed to the recipient's account address, and a break-glass sign-in e-mails each `BREAK_GLASS_ALERT_EMAILS` address (spec §3.6). Notifications are an outbox (D-47): a new row is `PENDING`, and the **e-mail dispatcher** — in the worker (or the API with `JOBS_MODE=in-process`), every 60 seconds under a 10-minute lease (spec §7.2) — sends it through the relay:

| Outcome | Row becomes |
| :--- | :--- |
| Relay accepted it | `SENT` |
| Relay refused or unreachable | stays `PENDING`, retried every `SMTP_RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS`; after `SMTP_RETRY_MAX` attempts `FAILED`, with the relay's error in `email_last_error` and an error log `e-mail delivery failed; giving up` |
| E-mail off (`SMTP_HOST` empty) or the recipient deactivated | `SKIPPED` |

Delivery is at-least-once: a crash after the relay accepted a message but before the row is updated sends it again, with the same `Message-ID`. Each message is plain text + HTML (UTF-8, English and Arabic), has no external images, and links only to `APP_BASE_URL`. Notifications stored before this release keep their status and are never e-mailed.

**Prerequisites from hospital IT:** the relay host and port, a service account, the sender and reply-to addresses, the relay's CA certificate if it is not publicly trusted (then set `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`), and — because production runs on Google Cloud (D-49) while the relay is on the hospital network — **private connectivity from the Google Cloud project to the relay** (Cloud VPN or Interconnect), with the relay allowing that source range.

**Go-live checklist** (spec §7.3): send one notification to a staging mailbox and check it in Outlook and on a phone (Arabic renders, From / Reply-To correct); run the expiry scan and confirm the e-mail arrives within about a minute; stop the relay and confirm retries and `FAILED` after the last attempt, then restart it and confirm new mail flows; sign in with the break-glass account and confirm the CEO and IT Director e-mails arrive.

### 2.3 Telegram (replaces SMS)

Every Telegram message goes through one gateway (`backend/src/lib/telegram.ts`, D-66); `NOTIFICATION_DRIVER` picks the driver. Telegram replaced SMS, whose live Saudi gateway needed a CST-registered Sender ID and so the hospital's Commercial Registration. Telegram's servers are outside the Kingdom, so **a message never carries personal data**: a generic prompt, times, and a link to the application — never a name, unit, shift or credential, nor the client's address.

| Driver | What `send` does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `mock` (default) | Saves the message as `intercepted` in `mock_telegram_outbox` and shows it in **Nursing Administration → Telegram inbox** (System Admin, elevated); nothing leaves the server, so development works offline. Kept 30 days (`mock-telegram-purge`, daily 02:40 Riyadh). In production the API logs `Telegram is simulated` at start-up as a reminder |
| `telegram` | `sendMessage` on the Bot API (`api.telegram.org:443`, 10-second timeout). A refusal or an outage is logged (chat id masked, token never logged) and answered as not accepted — never an error to the caller |

What is sent today: the break-glass sign-in, to each `BREAK_GLASS_ALERT_TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS` chat (spec §3.6), after the sign-in is committed, so a failing gateway never blocks emergency access. The outcome is audited HIGH (`BREAK_GLASS_TELEGRAM_SENT` or `BREAK_GLASS_TELEGRAM_FAILED`). For a demonstration, **Send test message** in the inbox sends any text to any chat id (audited `TELEGRAM_TEST_SENT`, the chat id masked).

**Connecting an account** (D-66): in **My account → Security → Telegram**, *Connect Telegram* shows a QR code and a link `https://t.me/<bot>?start=<token>` — single use, 15 minutes, only its SHA-256 stored. HR (or an elevated System Admin) can create one for an account in scope from **Accounts → Telegram link** and show it to the person. Opening it sends the bot `/start <token>` from the person's private chat, which links that chat (one chat per account, one account per chat; audited `TELEGRAM_LINKED`, and the account gets an in-app notice). `/stop` in the chat or *Disconnect* in the application unlinks it (`TELEGRAM_UNLINKED`). The bot's replies carry no name or e-mail. With the mock driver nothing reaches Telegram: in the Telegram inbox, *Simulate a message to the bot* with `/start <code>` links an account offline.

Going live: create the bot with @BotFather; set `NOTIFICATION_DRIVER=telegram`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` (from the deployment secrets) and `TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME`; allow outbound HTTPS to `api.telegram.org`; have the CEO and IT Director start a chat with the bot and put their chat ids in `BREAK_GLASS_ALERT_TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS`; send a test message from the inbox.

### 2.4 SCFHS licence checks (simulated until the SCFHS agreement)

Licences of a credential type with **Check with SCFHS** on (Credentials → Catalog; the type needs a field of data category `SCFHS_REG`) are checked with the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (spec §5.4, D-64): when the credential is recorded, when HR presses **SCFHS → Check with SCFHS now**, and nightly (`scfhs-sync`, 05:00 Riyadh). Every check is kept in `scfhs_verification_log` with the registration number reduced to its last four characters. The service needs the SCFHS agreement (decision gate U3), so production runs with **`SCFHS_DRIVER=mock`**: answers come from **Nursing Administration → SCFHS registry** (System Admin, elevated), where each registration number is given a status — valid, expired, suspended, revoked, or *ERROR* to simulate an outage; an unlisted number answers *not found*. Use synthetic numbers only.

| SCFHS answer | What happens |
| :--- | :--- |
| Valid, same expiry date as recorded | Nothing |
| Valid or expired with a different expiry date, or not found | The scoped HR admins get a HIGH notice (once per answer); the record is never overwritten |
| Suspended or revoked | With **Suspend on adverse SCFHS status** on the type: the credential is suspended at once (eligibility re-evaluated, audited HIGH `CREDENTIAL_SCFHS_SUSPENDED`) and HR told — revoking stays HR's decision. Otherwise HR is told |
| Unreachable | Logged as `ERROR`; the nightly run stops after 5 failures in a row and System health shows `SCFHS_UNREACHABLE` |

Going live: implement `LiveScfhsGateway.lookup` (`backend/src/lib/scfhs.ts`) against the SCFHS API contract, set `SCFHS_DRIVER=live`, `SCFHS_API_URL` and `SCFHS_API_KEY`, and check one known licence from the credential's SCFHS drawer.

### 2.5 Badge events (the badge system, and a simulator until it is connected)

Attendance gaps and coverage alerts (spec §14.2) compare the published roster with clock-ins in `attendance_events`. The badge system (PACS) delivers them to **`POST /api/v1/attendance/events`** (D-65): register it under **Nursing Administration → API clients** with the **`attendance.ingest`** scope, give its team the client id and secret, and it posts batches of up to 1000 events with a 15-minute token (docs/API.md §2.10 has the format). Each event is keyed by the nurse's job number and stored once — a resent batch is safe — and events that cannot be stored come back with their index and reason. The PACS interface contract is still open (B-15): if the vendor cannot send this format, a small adapter between the two is the job.

Until then, **Nursing Administration → Badge simulator** (System Admin, elevated) writes events through the same path, marked `simulator`: one swipe, or clock-ins for a unit's published shift with a chosen number of nurses left out, who then show as **MISSING** in the gap view and raise the coverage alert. Every simulation is audited HIGH, and **Clear simulated events** deletes them all. Simulated attendance must never reach payroll, so the simulator is **off in production** unless `BADGE_SIMULATOR=on`.

## 3. Processes and background jobs

| Process | Command | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| API | `npm run start -w backend` (`node dist/server.js`) | Runs the jobs itself only when `JOBS_MODE=in-process` |
| Worker | `npm run worker -w backend` (`node dist/jobs/worker.js`) | No HTTP listener; runs the scheduler. Start exactly one in production and set `JOBS_MODE=worker` on the API |
| Frontend | `npm run build -w frontend` → `frontend/dist/` | Static files served by the proxy; the build fails if the bundle budget is exceeded |

| `JOBS_MODE` on the API | Use |
| :--- | :--- |
| `in-process` | Development: one process does everything |
| `worker` | Production: the separate worker runs the jobs (spec §10.2) |
| `off` | Maintenance; nothing runs. Missed periods run when jobs are next enabled |

**Job schedule (Asia/Riyadh, independent of the server time zone):** `daily-transition` 00:05, `expiry-scan` 06:00, `consistency-audit` 03:00 (re-evaluates a random sample of nurses' eligibility — 1%, at least 50 — and corrects any drift, spec §10.8), `request-log-purge` 02:30 (deletes request-log rows older than 365 days, D-52), `mock-telegram-purge` 02:40 (deletes messages the mock Telegram gateway kept more than 30 days ago, D-66), `scfhs-sync` 05:00 (checks every current licence of an SCFHS-checked type with SCFHS, D-64), `vault-reconcile` 04:30 (document vault: removes orphaned objects older than a day, reports missing objects, re-verifies a random 50, counts unencrypted objects, deletes old download links — D-53), `attendance-alerts` every 15 minutes. Running two workers by mistake is safe (leases and unique run keys), but wasteful. A System Admin sees run history and can start a job from **Nursing Administration → Jobs**.

## 4. Release procedure

In production the **Deploy (VPS)** workflow does these steps with container images after a reviewer approves, then switches blue/green with no dropped requests ([ops/vps/README.md §6](../ops/vps/README.md#6-releases-github-actions-bluegreen)). By hand, on any server:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build                       # backend (prisma generate + tsc) and frontend (with bundle gate)
npm run db:deploy -w backend        # prisma migrate deploy as nurseapp_migration — never db push; there is no seed
psql -U <owner> -d <database> -f ops/db/02_grants.sql   # re-apply role privileges (ops/db/README.md)
psql -U postgres -d <database> -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f ops/db/verify.sql   # every check PASS, or stop here
# restart the API and the worker
curl -fsS https://<host>/api/v1/health   # 200 {"status":"ok","database":"up"}; 503 when the database is down
```

CI has already run the HTTPS browser test of the session cookies against the release images ([ops/e2e](../ops/e2e/README.md)).

After a release, a System Admin should open **Audit → Verify chain** (expected: intact) and **Nursing Administration → Jobs** (expected: recent runs completed).

**First release with PDPL field protection (D-54):** set `PDPL_FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `PDPL_BLIND_INDEX_PEPPER` before starting it. New Iqama, passport and SCFHS numbers are stored encrypted at once; numbers recorded earlier stay readable and are encrypted — and made searchable — by `npm run pdpl:protect -w backend` (container: `docker compose run --rm api node dist/cli/pdpl-protect.js`), safe to rerun. System health shows `PDPL_PLAINTEXT` until then. A System Admin and the DPO should review **Nursing Administration → Data protection** (the lawful basis per category, spec §8.3.2).

**First release with the document vault (D-53):** set `DOCUMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` before starting it (it refuses to start without it). New uploads are stored encrypted at once; files uploaded earlier are still served and are then encrypted by `npm run vault:encrypt -w backend` (in a container: `docker compose run --rm api node dist/cli/vault-encrypt.js`) — safe to interrupt and rerun. Nursing Administration → Jobs → System health reports `VAULT_PLAINTEXT` until it has run.

**First release with MFA (D-51):** set `MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` before starting the new version (it refuses to start without it). Every HR, supervisor and System Admin account is asked to set up an authenticator app at its next sign-in; sessions already open continue until they end (at most 24 hours). Tell those users beforehand to install an authenticator app (Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator or similar). A lost phone: the person signs in with a recovery code, or HR / a System Admin resets it in **Nursing Administration → Accounts → Reset two-factor** after confirming who is asking.

**Development only — two-factor sign-in off for testing:** after `npm run build -w backend`, `npm run mfa -w backend -- off` takes `SYSTEM_ADMIN` out of `MFA_REQUIRED_ROLES` in `backend/.env` and removes the System Admin accounts' authenticators (audited `MFA_RESET`); `-- on` puts the role back (a new authenticator is set up at the next sign-in); `-- status` shows the list and who has one. Other roles: `-- off HR_ADMIN SUPERVISOR`. Restart the backend after each. The command refuses to run with `NODE_ENV=production`, where the roles are mandatory (spec §3.5).

**First release after commit 10b:** the reminder job sends each record's current milestone once under the new milestone keys (D-39); contracts that already ended without a renewal get one "Contract ended" notice.

### Go-live preparation (before creating the production database)

Owner decision 2026-09-24: the two safety nets of the database-first migration ([DATABASE_MIGRATION.md](DATABASE_MIGRATION.md)) are retired **before** the production database is created, so production never carries them. If go-live is not scheduled by **2026-10-24**, do it then anyway.

1. Fresh backup of the development database `nurseapp_v04` (`pg_dump -Fc`) — the new rollback point.
2. A migration drops `credential_templates.field_defs_legacy` (remove it from `schema.prisma` and from `presentTemplate` in `credentials/fields.ts`); full test suite; applied to the development and test databases. In a fresh database the column is always empty, so it protects nothing in production.
3. The owner deletes `C:\WebApp_project\Local_Repo\backups\nurseapp_v04_pre-db-first.dump` and `nurseapp_test_pre-db-first.dump` (development data only; deleting files is the owner's step).
4. Keep the Git tag `pre-db-first` (code only, no data).
5. Record the date and decision in [DATABASE_MIGRATION.md §8](DATABASE_MIGRATION.md#8-follow-up-after-the-final-report).

**Status 2026-09-24:** steps 1, 2, 4 and 5 done at the owner's request (backup `nurseapp_v04_pre-go-live_2026-09-24.dump`; migration `20260926090000_drop_field_defs_legacy`). Step 3 done by the owner the same day: both `pre-db-first` dumps deleted; `backups\` holds only the new dump. Go-live preparation is complete.

Then the production database is created as below.

### First installation (empty database)

1. Database roles ([ops/db/README.md](../ops/db/README.md)): `01_roles.sql` as a superuser, set the four passwords with `\password`, `02_grants.sql` as the database owner; `DATABASE_URL` = `nurseapp_runtime`, `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` = `nurseapp_migration`. The API and worker refuse to start in production while `DATABASE_URL` can change the schema.
2. `npm run db:deploy -w backend`, then `02_grants.sql` again, then `verify.sql` as the superuser (every check PASS) — the structure only; the database holds no data and no accounts.
3. `npm run bootstrap -w backend` in an interactive terminal on the server — creates the first System Admin and a hospital-wide HR Admin (two people, so approvals work) and optionally the break-glass account. It refuses to run once any account exists.
4. The HR Admin signs in, opens **Nursing Administration → Hospital baseline import**, previews the hospital's baseline file (the reference is `backend/prisma/baseline/aigh-baseline.json`) and requests the import; the System Admin elevates (PAM) and approves it. It is applied in one transaction or not at all.
5. Credential requirements (the hospital's credential policy), accounts, employees and contracts are then entered through the application.

Never run the demo fixtures on a production database; the command refuses `NODE_ENV=production` and any database with accounts.

### Releasing new eligibility rules (shadow mode, D-60)

A change to who is eligible never goes live directly (spec §10.9). The developer adds the new engine as a new version in `ENGINES` (`backend/src/modules/eligibility/logic.ts`) and leaves the current one in place. After the release, the API logs `eligibility logic registered` with `status: SHADOW`, and from then on:

1. Every recalculation runs both versions; nurses keep getting the active result. HR sees each disagreement in **Nursing Administration → Eligibility logic** (System health: `ELIGIBILITY_SHADOW_UNDECIDED`).
2. A system-wide HR Admin marks each one *New logic is right* or *New logic is wrong*, with a note. A wrong one, or a failure of the new logic, means it cannot be promoted: **Retire** it, fix the engine as a newer version, release again.
3. **Promote** becomes available after 7 days with no disagreement, or once every disagreement is approved. Promotion recalculates every nurse at once (the API logs `eligibility re-evaluated after promotion`).

Rolling the release back after a promotion is safe: the older release does not ship the new version, so the last promoted version it does ship decides (logged as an error until the release is redeployed).

## 5. Backups and restore

The scripts, their environment contract and the verified drill are in [`ops/backup/README.md`](../ops/backup/README.md): WAL archiving, an encrypted nightly base backup, point-in-time restore and a restore drill.

**Documents (D-53):** the database holds each document's checksum and storage key; the bytes are in `STORAGE_DIR`, encrypted. Back up `STORAGE_DIR` on the same schedule (on the VPS the off-site copy mirrors the vault every 5 minutes, [ops/vps/README.md §5](../ops/vps/README.md#5-backups-and-point-in-time-recovery-on-one-machine); on the Google Cloud alternative: snapshots of the app VM's data disk), keep `DOCUMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` with the backup keys, and after a restore let `vault-reconcile` run (or start it from Nursing Administration → Jobs): it lists any document whose object did not come back.

### Rotating a key

The four keys (`MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `DOCUMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `PDPL_FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `PDPL_BLIND_INDEX_PEPPER`) can each be replaced without downtime (B-18, D-56) — on a schedule the hospital's key policy sets, when someone who held a key leaves, or at once if one may have leaked:

1. Generate the new key (`openssl rand -base64 32`). Put it in the key's variable and the old value in `<NAME>_PREVIOUS`; restart the API and the worker. Data under either key now reads; everything new uses the new key. System health shows `KEY_ROTATION_PENDING`.
2. Run `npm run keys:rotate -w backend -- --check` to see what is left, then `npm run keys:rotate -w backend` (container: `docker compose run --rm api node dist/cli/keys-rotate.js`). It re-wraps each employee's data key, rebuilds the identifier search index, re-seals authenticator seeds and re-wraps each stored file's key in place — audited `KEYS_ROTATED`, safe to interrupt and rerun. It exits non-zero while anything is left or failed.
3. When it reports `"done": true`, remove `<NAME>_PREVIOUS` and restart. Keep the old key with the backup keys until the last backup made before step 3 has expired (`BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS`): restoring such a backup needs it.

Rotate one key at a time or several together; `JWT_SECRET` is replaced by simply changing it (everyone signs in again). Where keys live — deployment secrets today, a KMS or HSM with the hosting decision (spec §13.4.1) — is unchanged by this. After the first release with rotation support, run `npm run keys:rotate -w backend` once: rows written before it carry no key id, and System health reports them until then.

**DPO sign-off (B-18, D-56):** the Data Protection Officer reviews **Nursing Administration → Data protection** and records a sign-off there (from an HR Admin or System Admin account). The register as reviewed is kept with it. System health shows `PDPL_REGISTER_SIGN_OFF_DUE` until the first sign-off, a year after the last one, and after any change to the register.

**Erasures after a restore (D-55, spec §8.3.3 "the destroyed key is never restored"):** a backup taken before an erasure still holds that employee's key. After restoring one, search the application logs for `personal data erased` lines newer than the backup and run `npm run pdpl:reerase -w backend -- <employeeId> …` for those employees (container: `docker compose run --rm api node dist/cli/pdpl-reerase.js <employeeId> …`). It destroys the key again, removes the search rows and identity scans, and is audited; an employee already erased is skipped. Keep the application logs at least as long as the backups.

**Schedule (D-40):** nightly at **01:00 Asia/Riyadh (22:00 UTC)**, as spec §10.6 says. `aigh-backup.timer` names the `Asia/Riyadh` time zone, so it is right whatever the host clock; `crontab.example` has one line for a UTC host and one for a Riyadh host — use exactly one. It does not collide with the application jobs (00:05 and 06:00 Riyadh).

### Exit package (spec §14.3, D-62)

To move the workforce history to another provider: `node dist/cli/exit-package.js --reason "<why>" --out <file.zip | ->` in the API container writes one ZIP with the workforce master, contract history, credentials (sensitive values opened), every evidence file decrypted under the standard `EMP_<id>_<TEMPLATE>_<date>` names, the hash-chained audit log with the inputs of each hash, and a SHA-256 manifest; audited HIGH. It holds personal data in clear: on the VPS use `deploy.sh exit-package "<reason>"`, which encrypts it to the backup public key without a plaintext copy on disk ([ops/vps/README.md §8](../ops/vps/README.md#exit-package-moving-to-another-provider)).

## 6. Known gaps before production

| Gap | Effect | What is needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Database roles: to be applied on each server** (spec §10.7) | [`ops/db`](../ops/db/README.md) holds the roles, grants and a read-only check (`verify.sql`), all tested in CI; the open spec items are decided (D-44, D-45). The API and worker **refuse to start in production** until `DATABASE_URL` is a data-only login | On each server: the README steps 1–5 (a DBA, about 15 minutes), `verify.sql` all PASS, then switch the URLs |
| **Prisma CLI advisories** | `npm audit`: 4 high-severity advisories in the Prisma CLI's bundled dependencies (`mysql2`, `deepmerge-ts`). The CLI is a development/migration tool; the running API uses `@prisma/client` with the PostgreSQL adapter and does not load the MySQL driver. npm's suggested "fix" downgrades to Prisma 6 (breaking) and was **not** applied | Run migrations from the CI/release host rather than installing dev tools on the runtime host; upgrade Prisma when a patched release exists; re-run `npm audit` at every release |
| **`pg` 9 not yet usable** | Inside an interactive transaction Prisma 7.10's query interpreter reads the relations of a multi-relation `include` concurrently on the transaction's single `pg` client ([prisma/prisma#29407](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/29407)). `pg` 8 queues the queries (results are correct) but prints its "client is already executing a query" deprecation, which `pg` 9 turns into a failure. The application's own code issues transaction queries one at a time | Stay on `pg` 8 until a Prisma release with the fix; then upgrade both together and run the full test suite |
| **Telegram bot not set up** (D-66) | The break-glass Telegram alert goes through the gateway, but with `NOTIFICATION_DRIVER=mock` it is kept in the Dev Console Telegram inbox and not sent (§2.3) | A bot from @BotFather owned by the hospital, its token in the deployment secrets, outbound HTTPS to `api.telegram.org`, and the CEO's and IT Director's chat ids |
| **SCFHS simulated** (D-64) | Licence checks answer from the simulated registry (§2.4), not from SCFHS | The SCFHS agreement (U3) and its API contract; then `LiveScfhsGateway` |
| **Badge system not connected** (D-33, D-65) | The ingest endpoint is built (§2.5) but no badge system sends to it yet; until then attendance gaps and alerts show only simulated events | The badge system's vendor sends our format, or the PACS contract (B-15) and an adapter; register it as an API client with `attendance.ingest` |
| **Production server not yet provisioned** (spec §8.3.6, §10.4; D-57) | The single-VPS layout — blue/green releases, backups with an off-site copy, alerts, the exit package — is built and passes its end-to-end harness ([ops/vps](../ops/vps/README.md)); no server in the Kingdom exists yet. A Hostinger VPS may hold synthetic data only (no data centre in the Kingdom) | A VPS in a data centre in the Kingdom, with a contract that says so, and an S3-compatible off-site bucket in the Kingdom; then ops/vps/README.md §2–§9, including the restore drill |

## 7. Monitoring

| Signal | Where |
| :--- | :--- |
| Liveness and database | `GET /api/v1/health` |
| Logs | One JSON line per event on stdout with `requestId`; no personal data. Every response carries `X-Request-Id` |
| Background jobs | `job_runs` (Nursing Administration → Jobs); the `worker_lease_status` view shows lease holders and heartbeats |
| Audit integrity | `GET /api/v1/audit/verify` (Audit page); the `audit_chain_breaks` view must be empty |
| Malware scanner | Error log lines `malware detected in upload`, `upload scan failed; upload refused` and `clamav signatures are stale`; HIGH audit `DOCUMENT_REJECTED_INFECTED` |
| Break-glass use | CRITICAL in-app notification and e-mail to every System Admin; e-mail to `BREAK_GLASS_ALERT_EMAILS`; a Telegram message to `BREAK_GLASS_ALERT_TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS` (HIGH audit `BREAK_GLASS_TELEGRAM_FAILED` if the gateway refused it); `break_glass_events` |
| Other systems (FHIR API clients, D-63) | Nursing Administration → **API clients**: last token time per client. Audit `API_CLIENT_AUTH_FAILED` (a wrong secret or a revoked client still trying); the client's reads in Audit → Requests as `API client: <name>` |
| SCFHS licence checks | System health `SCFHS_UNREACHABLE` / `SCFHS_ERRORS` and the last nightly run (`scfhs-sync` summary); HR notices for differences; audit `CREDENTIAL_SCFHS_SUSPENDED` |
| Request log | **Audit → Requests** (`GET /api/v1/audit/requests`, System Admin): every API request with its actor, outcome and error code — filter by user, path, `4xx`/`5xx`, error code or request id (the `X-Request-Id` a user reports). Growth: roughly 1 row per request; kept 365 days |
| Business health | Nursing Administration → Jobs → **System health** (`GET /api/v1/system/health/business`): eligibility drift found and corrected by the daily consistency audit, jobs that are late or failed, e-mail backlog and failures. System Admins also get an in-app notice on any day drift is corrected |
| E-mail delivery | Error log `e-mail delivery failed; giving up`. Backlog: `SELECT email_status, count(*), min(created_at) FROM notifications WHERE created_at > now() - interval '1 day' GROUP BY 1` — a growing `PENDING` count or old `min` means the relay or the worker is down; the same for `email_outbox.status` |
